Hello! I am Ivy, a current PhD student at the Department of Bioengineering, Northeastern University. I am privileged to be studying under the guidance of Professor Qianqian Fang in the <a href= 'http://fanglab.org/wiki/'>Computational Optics and Translational Imaging Lab</a>. I hold a Bachelor’s and a Master’s degree in Biomedical Engineering from National Cheng Kung University, Taiwan.

Before embarking on my journey at Northeastern, I worked as a Research Assistant at the Biosignal and Neural Engineering Lab at National Cheng Kung University in Taiwan. I was also a Graduate Student Intern at the <a href='https://www.fnndsc.org/fnndsc-student-internship'>Fetal-Neonatal Neuroimaging Developmental Science Center</a>, Boston Children’s Hospital in the USA for my Master's research.

<b>Research:</b> Currently, my work involves enhancing the applicability of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and EEG electrodes using an augmented reality tool guided by facial landmarks. This approach aims to revolutionize neuroimaging practices by improving ease of use, reducing setup time, and increasing the precision of optode or electrode placement.
